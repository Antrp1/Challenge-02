## Horiseon Webpage

- The webpage was passed to me to get some enhancements.
- I worked on this project because it was bland and not appealing to the eye.
- This solved viewers interest once accessing the webpage.
- I learned that not every developer thinks the same, and there are multiple different ways to apply the same code.
  
  ## Description
  - I liked the original layout of the page but the colors were too plain, therefore I added some more eye pleasing colors.
  - With this, I made sure that the headings of each section are more visible and don't get mixed up with the contents underneath.
  - I also decided to get of some unecessary code that was just taking up space.

  ## Collaborators
  - Anthony Padfield
