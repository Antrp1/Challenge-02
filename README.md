# Challenge-02

## Portfolio Webpage
- My professional portfolio.
- Inlcuded is contact information as well as links to my professional resume.
  
  ## Description
  - I liked the original layout of the page but the colors were too plain, therefore I added some more eye pleasing colors.
  - With this, I made sure that the headings of each section are more visible and don't get mixed up with the contents underneath.
  - I also decided to get of some unecessary code that was just taking up space.

  ## Collaborators
  - Anthony Padfield
